One strategy he used was instead of moving around the ring, Ali chose to fight for extended periods of time leaning back into the ropes in order to avoid many of the heaviest blows.", "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.", "It's the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief. And once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen.", "It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe.", "Life is a gamble. You can get hurt, but people die in plane crashes, lose their arms and legs in car accidents; people die every day. Same with fighters: some die, some get hurt, some go on. You just don't let yourself believe it will happen to you.", "Life is a gamble. You can get hurt, but people die in plane crashes, lose their arms and legs in car accidents; people die every day.

Their second fight should have put that notion to rest as Ali knocked Liston out in the very first round of their rematch. The moment was captured in what became one of the most iconic sports pictures ever taken. Ali standing over Liston screaming at him to get up. Ali assumed that he had put any doubt about his legitimacy to rest instead the knockout became one of the most controversial highly debated sports moments ever. A great deal of fans and even professionals in the boxing world believed that Liston had taken a dive and some claim that Ali had never thrown a punch at all, giving rise to the conspiracy theory of the phantom punch the controversy was so great that a segment aired on TV with boxing experts discussing the matter. The guests included former heavyweight champions Jack Dempsey and Rocky Marciano but as slow-motion footage later revealed ali's punch did in fact connect.",

Over the course of 10 seconds, Ali dodges 21 punches and then moves away from the corner with a good amount of swagger, taunting Dokes with a little dance. A throwback video is available on YouTube.",

That's like taking a direct shot on a knee strike from a hundred and eighty five pound UFC fighter and this secret to Lee's technique starts with his stance.",

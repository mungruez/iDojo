You can get hurt, but people die in plane crashes, lose their arms and legs in car accidents; people die every day. Same with fighters: some die, some get hurt, some go on.

Their second fight should have put that notion to rest as Ali knocked Liston out in the very first round of their rematch. The moment was captured in what became one of the most iconic sports pictures ever taken. Ali standing over Liston screaming at him to get up. Ali assumed that he had put any doubt about his legitimacy to rest instead the knockout became one of the most controversial highly debated sports moments ever. A great deal of fans and even professionals in the boxing world believed that Liston had taken a dive and some claim that Ali had never thrown a punch at all, giving rise to the conspiracy theory of the phantom punch the controversy was so great that a segment aired on TV with boxing experts discussing the matter. The guests included former heavyweight champions Jack Dempsey and Rocky Marciano but as slow-motion footage later revealed ali's punch did in fact connect.",

Over the course of 10 seconds, Ali dodges 21 punches and then moves away from the corner with a good amount of swagger, taunting Dokes with a little dance. A throwback video is available on YouTube.",

That's like taking a direct shot on a knee strike from a hundred and eighty five pound UFC fighter and this secret to Lee's technique starts with his stance.",

          desc: "From a side facing stance, take a small lead with the front foot, using it to launch yourself toward the target. As you bring the rear foot toward the front foot, both feet momentarily leave the ground and the rear foot replaces where the front foot was. That's where the lunge happens (a side lunge in this case which becomes your kick). This gives you a deceptively fast approach to the target, and if you work on the timing a bit you can make it quite powerful as well. The difficult part is coordinating the chamber of the kick with the replacement step so that your kick lands as the rear foot makes the replacement. That lets you add the power of your rear leg to the momentum of the kick to make it particularly powerful. You don't see this lunging sidekick very often in the MMA because it's a high commitment move that requires a big opening, but you do sometimes see it as a followup.",

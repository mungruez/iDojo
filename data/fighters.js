As you bring the rear foot toward the front foot, both feet momentarily leave the ground and the rear foot replaces where the front foot was. That's where the lunge happens (a side lunge in this case which becomes your kick). This gives you a deceptively fast approach to the target, and if you work on the timing a bit you can make it quite powerful as well. The difficult part is coordinating the chamber of the kick with the replacement step so that your kick lands as the rear foot makes the replacement. That lets you add the power of your rear leg to the momentum of the kick to make it particularly powerful. You don't see this lunging sidekick very often in the MMA because it's a high commitment move that requires a big opening, but you do sometimes see it as a followup.",

I think he could make a run in MMA as well. His fan-friendly fighting style is pure aggression complimented by insane durability. I'm a big fan, so I decided to write a brief rundown on some physical attributes Rodtang possesses that may help explain his combat success. Rodtang relies on unrelenting aggression to overwhelm his opponents, often delivering the finish when they are utterly exhausted. Such a fighting style requires elite cardiovascular fitness. Rodtang performs long distance roadwork to build his body's overall aerobic engine. But he also hits pads with the same ferocity he would display in a fight.

But while those fighters tend to possess explosive straight punches, much of Rodtang's best work has been done with vicious hooks. His build could help him throw those shorter shots with more angular velocity. And his low center of gravity gives him the leverage needed to really drive his trademark liver shots. Rodtang's renowned durability may be partially explained by his anatomy as well. Thick skull bones absorb less impact energy and may be harder to deform. Skull deformation can cause brain contusions in trauma and is therefore one example of a major brain injury mechanism. Stabilizing this large head is a short, thick neck and well-developed traps. Rodtang is often able to predict his opponents' attacks and activate those muscles just prior to impact, potentially preventing concussions by limiting excessive head acceleration.",

      desc: ["From the retraction of punches to something as seemingly simple as maintaining stance while moving, Buakaw Banchamek has spent countless hours honing his skills to score a victory against his opponents. To work on your technique, start with the basics and slowly drill the movements from start to finish until they are ingrained in your muscle memory. Start with simple footwork in all directions, ensuring that you return to your exact stance between each step. Then slowly practice your basic punches and kicks. Pay close attention to the trajectories of each strike, making sure to intentionally control the extension and retraction manually. While doing this, be sure to maintain steady breathing and activate your core. Although his may seem tedious, working on the basics in this manner will elevate your skill level immensely. You will get far more out of your training if you spend time perfecting one or two techniques at a time, instead of practicing a new combo every day. Everyone’s body is different; the goal of improving your physical conditioning is not to be a clone of Buakaw but rather to realize your own individual physical potential. Some people have a propensity for strength and endurance. Others may find that training explosive power and cardio yields better results. Buakaw’s level of physical conditioning is insane, and it is one of his greatest advantages over his opponents. He is able to maintain a consistent output for the course of an entire fight, throwing sixty to seventy percent of his maximum power with each strike. Buakaw’s cardio allows him to apply pressure on his opponent and push the pace of the fight to his advantage. He also trains for strength endurance – that is, the ability to continuously output force over and over again. Without strength endurance, you would be able to throw many strikes before gassing out; however, only your first few strikes would land with any power. Strength endurance gives you the ability to throw continuously with power throughout multiple rounds. In addition, Buakaw also trains for explosive power – the ability to put maximum force in a single strike. This is what lets him capitalize on his opponent’s weaknesses, overwhelming them and knocking them out with a single blow."],

Buakaw forgoes many fancier, more advanced, defensive options in favor of a solid long guard. He most often holds his rear hand by his cheek, akin to a high guard, while his lead arm is extended in a classic Muay Thai long guard. The long guard effectively shuts down most attacks aimed at the head, while giving you control over your opponent’s posture and hand position. Buakaw will use the long guard to block and walk through heavy strikes, from punches to head kicks with knockout power. He will often use his extended lead arm to frame his opponent’s collarbone while hand-fighting with his rear hand. Once his opponent is off balance and exposed, Buakaw delivers devastating strikes. Buakaw also uses a tight high guard when his opponent can punch around his long guard. This seemingly small adjustment allows for better defense against punches and takes away his opponent’s biggest advantage.

This can be deceptively draining as Buakaw aims for his opponent’s solar plexus, making it more and more difficult to breathe with each landed teep. Buakaw can also teep from long range. He does this by throwing a hybrid side teep. Buakaw uses this to force his opponents back, knocking them off balance and leaving them open to follow-up strikes.",

So it doesn't take much to break his grip, and the closer your hands are to your own neck the greater the leverage."

This reduces the time your opponent has to respond to just tenths of a second. But the real focus is to aim your strike at the throat. Because as little as seventy six pounds of force can collapse the larynx, the strike doesn't need to deliver a lot of force to be deadly. One blow like this and the fight is over."

It's enough to stun and probably not enough to cause severe injury, but replace the hand with a weapon, a stick, or a knife as you would in combat and this could become a kill shot."

It's the same principle that cracks a whip, turning the hips just a few degrees forces the foot to travel a much greater distance, and creates a lot of speed as it does. The longer the leg and quicker the rotation the faster the kick, and unlike karate, my Tai fighters are also taught to strike with the hard bone of the shin. A My Thai kick can generate roughly the same force as a baseball bat, enough to crack a rib or a lake."

In conjunction with the snap of the knee, the foot achieves a velocity of nearly thirty miles per hour. When the heel connects with the solar plexus, it transfers fourteen hundred pounds of force.

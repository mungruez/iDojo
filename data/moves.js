From just a finger length away Lee could produce an impact that just didn't seem humanly possible. Visually it's like watching a batter turn a bunt into a homerun. In a move that lasts about as long as a flash of lightning Lee could generate between two hundred and thirty and four hundred and seventy pounds of force, that's like taking a direct shot on a knee strike from a hundred and eighty five pound UFC fighter and the secret to Lee's technique starts with his stance. Check out how he aligns his body. His hips and shoulders are turned, which cree ates a direct path from his back foot into his target, and after he pushes off the ground with approximately three hundred pounds of ground reaction force, Lees muscles start to tighten up. Now in a more typical punch or even a quarterbacks throwing motion, the ground reaction forces are used to help unwind the body around a pivot point, but in Lees one inch punch, his stance and contracting muscle groups ensure there is no pivot point, and like a Newtons Cradle transferring energy between its spheres, this maximizes the energy transfer from Lees back foot to his fist. On a Newton's Cradle, if there's too much space between the balls or they collide at different angles energy is lost and this is why the one inch punch is so devastating. After pushing off the ground, his rapidly tightening muscle groups become the middle three balls and his opponent becomes the last one and the timing required to optimize this energy transfer is basically super human. Studies have shown the coordination and force on techniques like this are directly related to the amount of white matter in the brain. This tissue relays information between different cortical regions at speeds of more than two hundred and fifty miles per hour. The more white matter in the brain the better that info gets related and while it's impossible to know how much white matter lee possessed, this might help explain why most people including the elite athletes, just can't move like Bruce Lee."

        desc:"The move is difficult but devastating. There is no opposing object to push against, so all the energy of the move, must come from the momentum of the leap and the acceleration of the kick. The snapping motion of the lower leg functions much like a coiled spring. When unleashed, the kick reaches impact speeds of twenty miles per hour and delivers up to four hundred pounds of force to the opponent's chest."

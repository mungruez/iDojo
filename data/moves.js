This reduces the time your opponent has to respond to just tenths of a second. But the real focus is to aim your strike at the throat. Because as little as seventy six pounds of force can collapse the larynx, the strike doesn't need to deliver a lot of force to be deadly. One blow like this and the fight is over."
